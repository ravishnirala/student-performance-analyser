## Methodology
# Problem Statement
   Given historical student performance data and relevant features, build a regression model that can accurately predict the final grades of students.
# Data
   The dataset should include features like study hours, attendance, previous exam scores, and final grades. It should be split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
# Techniques
   Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
   Feature selection: Identify the most relevant features for prediction.
   Model selection: Choose regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) and perform hyperparameter tuning.
# Architecture
   The architecture consists of the following components:
     1. Data Ingestion: Fetch and preprocess data.
     2. Data preprocessing: Implement the data preprocessing technique.
     3. Model Training: Build and train the regression model.
     4. Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using test data.
     5. Model Deployment: Deploy the model using a suitable platform.
# Pipeline
  1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
  2. Feature Engineering & Selection
  3. Model Building & Training
  4. Model Evaluation & Metrics Calculation
  5. Model Deployment & Monitoring

## Conclusion
   In this project, we have showcased a comprehensive approach to predict student performance using a regression model and ML practices. By accurately predicting student grades, educational institutions can take proactive measures to support struggling students and enhance overall academic success.
